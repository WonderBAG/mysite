    <h2 style="color:cornflowerblue">Santorini´s best</h2>
    <p>Santorini was probably top 5 on my bucket list,
      I was always dreaming of going there, looking at stunning pictures and envying out those beautiful landscapes whenever I came across one of those stunning pictures on the internet.
    <br></br> However, I never did anything about it until one day, out of the blue, one of my friends from Poland told me something like "hey, let´s go on a trip together, somewhere that´s not too far from Poland and that you would also love to go", and as
  funny as that sounds now, we were planning a trip to Greece in less than 24 hours of our first thought on it.
<br></br>
  First we arrived to Athens,  we spent there a couple of days visiting the majestuous Parthenon, the temple of Olympian Zeus, and walking throw its particular alleys that somehow reminded me of Rome (btw, if you ever find yourself in Greece you should totally give Athens a try)
<br></br>
So, moving on to Santorini, we took an airplane from Athens to Santorini, arriving by midnight, because as native of the new continent as I am, I thought that it would be easy peasy to move ourselves from the airport to the hotel, but little did I know that there´s no metro in Santorini,
nor buses passing by in the middle of the night; luckly for us, my friend and me where splitted into different rows in the airplane, and she got to talk to one guy that was quite friendly to lift us to our hotel, I said luckly enough because I would have neeeever even talked to him, and if I <head>
had  I would´ve never accepted the ride, but thank god everything was alright, he was just nice and we got safe and sound over there.
<br></br>
The place you see in most of the pictures of Santorini with the beautiful white Dome is called Oia, which is north of the Island, now let me spoil it a little bit for you, it´s stunning don´t get me wrong, but everything is private, so if you want to do anything there you most likely will have to pay for it,
but what you should totally do while you are there is watching the Sunset, rumor has it is one of the most beautiful Sunsets you´ll ever get to see.

<br></br>
Now, if you are on a budget, like we were, I recommend you look for a place to stay in Thera, which is in the middle west of the island, and is equally beautiful, plus you can walk a lot more and explore as you like there.

<br></br>
Thera is the place where you can find the typical greek donkeys, and they can even take you through a trail all the way to Oia.

Tip: Allow yourself some extra money for having a nice dinner at one of the restaurants infront of the bay, just make sure to do your reservation with at least 24hr in advance. Trust me, the food is totally worth it, and the view is from out of this world.
