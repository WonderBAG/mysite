    <h2 style="color:cornflowerblue">Living in Taiwan and what I miss the Most </h2>
      <br>
      <p>As I first said, I spent one year of my life living in the beautiful Island of Taiwan, this was an exhange I did as part of the exchange program from Rotary International for teenagers.<br></br> At 17 years old, I knew I wanted to learn <em>mandarin</em> mainly because I pictured myself doing big, important, businesses with Chinese magnates once I grew up (which has not yet happened, nor is it even close to my current reality). I remember being totally out of place when I first arrived to Taichung, the city I would be living in and that would later become my second home. The streets were flowded with a stinky tofu smell that I wasn´t really a fan of, the heat was seriously sultry, my host family couldn´t understand a bit of what I was trying to say in the few words I´ve learned in my mandarin chinese summer course, I was feeling overwhelmed and lonely,  and I was praying for the day to come back home to arrive. <br></br> However evolution was yet to come to me, after a few weeks I started perfectioning my accent in the new foreign language I was introduced to, people started understanding my broken mandarin and I started feeling more motivated, even more because every time a foreigner speaks a few words in chinese Taiwanese people will make you feel as if you were the pro of pros in learning it, which can be a real motivator if you know you are making mistakes like crazy, but still are not criticized by it.</p>
<p>So in order to recall on those moments that help build the woman I am today I am listing 5 things I miss the most of those days.</p>

<h3>5 Things I miss the most:</h3>
<ol><li>The food: I know I said I wasn´t a fan of stinky tofu, and tbh I never became a Fan of it, but i certainly loooooooved the "mian" 麵 (chinese noodles) and the satiety feeling each meal in Taiwan had on my stomach </li>

   <li>The laguage: certainly this has to come after the amazing food, because I enjoy eating, who doesn´t! right? But my passion in life is to learn languages, and chinese language is the most beautiful language I know, just look at this: </li>

   <li>The floor toilets: this one might sound particularily strange, but think about it, as a girl, you never have to come into contact or near contact to the flty public place someone else was so close to. I actually never thought about this one until I cam back home and I realized how convenient was it over there.</li>

   <li>Their metro system: Always clean, always on time and with beautiful sceneries, it´s the perfect transportation system, not even in Germany was I as happy with their railroad system as I was in Taiwan.</li>

   <li>Life with my friends: this is a pretty basic one, we always have a support system, and for me all of my friends experimenting the same thing as I was going through was key to my happiness.</li></ol>
