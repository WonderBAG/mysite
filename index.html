    <p><i>Hello there!</i> Welcome to my webpage, this is a small project I´m working at as part of my quarantine goals in coding, but if you like <em>travelling</em> you might find this quite interesting and hopefully enjoyable.<br></br>
      My name is Brenda, and my first long period experience away from home was when I was 17 years old and lived for a whole year in the beautiful asian island of Taiwan, 9 years have gone by, but the memories will always stick, and that wanderlust effect never went away.
  I think that´s partly the reason why ever since I feel like travelling is part of my self care routine every once in a while, so in this website I´ve collected pictures and fun facts of some of my best travelling experiences, hopefully you´ll have as much fun reading it as I had creating the content.  </p>
